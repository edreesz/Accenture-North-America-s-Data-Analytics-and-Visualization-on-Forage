Top Categories: The analysis revealed that animals, healthy eating, technology, science, and cooking are the top 5 content categories with the highest reaction counts.

Engagement Trends: The "animals" category led in positive emotional reactions such as "adore" and "super love", while science and technology attracted more curiosity-based reactions like "intrigued" and "interested".

Actionable Strategy: Focus on producing more content in top-performing categories while enhancing emotional resonance in science and technology to boost engagement.
